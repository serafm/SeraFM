## 🎓 Diploma Thesis

I recently completed my [diploma thesis](https://github.com/serafm/rtree_cpp), focusing on **Geospatial Data and Indexes in C++**.  
The project involved implementing an efficient **R-tree** structure.  
Its performance was **compared with the R-tree implementation of the Boost library**, highlighting key differences in efficiency and design choices.  
This work gave me extensive experience in spatial indexing, data structures, and performance optimization using modern C++.
